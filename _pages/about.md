Hello! I am Anuj Gupta, a final-year undergraduate in Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay. I have always been deeply fascinated by the domain of machine learning, with a particular interest in computer vision and natural language processing, as well as their underlying mathematics, including probability and optimization.

I am currently working with Prof. Amit Sethi and Gouranga Bala at Medal Lab, IIT Bombay, on my B.Tech thesis project, where we are developing a pipeline for robust training on noisy label datasets. We are using a hybrid of self-supervised and supervised learning, and currently, we are outperforming many previous state-of-the-art techniques. An initial draft of our work has been published on arXiv as a preprint.

In my penultimate year, I completed a quantitative internship at Goldman Sachs, Bangalore, as a Summer Analyst in the Risk Division. The project involved benchmarking multiple covariance functions, such as Ornstein-Uhlenbeck and Squared Exponential, to model the Interest Rate Forward Curve (e.g., SOFR) using Gaussian Processes.

Apart from academics, I enjoy reading, and I am also passionate about playing chess and cricket. Feel free to connect with me!
